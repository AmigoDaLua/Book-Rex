# BookRex: my CS50's final project
**BookRex** is a web application that collects reading recommendations from users.
Anyone can submit their book recommendations, contributing to spread the word around.

## The app
All this started some 4 months ago: I was looking for a way to become a software developer 
so I've started **Harvard's CS50** via Fundação Estudar. Until this year (2022), I just had some basic
notions of HTML, CSS and Python that I'd learned for fun through the years. But, how I said, 
I was looking for real, solid knowledge.

And I've found it: thanks to CS50 and it's wonderful content, now I have a whole new 
vision about those magic machines that we call computers. 

## The project
To complete the course, a final project is required: we'd been asked to make something with
 all we learned, something meaningful, useful. Since I love books, I've decided (after some
 restless days) to join the two worlds together and develop a web application about them. 

## Implementation
The hours of reading, coding and hard work all worth it: BookRex is a simple and cool app
made in Flask; I've used Python to build the application itself, but the pages 
gain life thanks to HTML and CSS; and, yeah, there's a SQLite3 database to save all the
recommendations.

* **Index** shows the form for recommendations

<img
  src="/img/index .png"
  alt="Index page"
  style="display: inline-block;  padding: 10px; max-width: 300px">

* **Recommendations** exibits all the recs made so far

<img
  src="/img/recommendations.gif"
  alt="Recomendations page"
  style="display: inline-block;  padding: 10px; max-width: 300px">
  
Do not found a book yet? No problem: at the bottom of Recommendations' page there's a link to the Open Library's Book Trending List, so the show will never stop.

## Last words
I am very happy to get here, because it was very fun and because now I know without a doubt that I want to be a Python Developer.
